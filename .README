This is a simple webpage one can use to generate Uniview HTML buttons.
The deployment is live on [github pages](https://hankangbok.github.io/Uniview-Button-Generator/)

ToDo:
- Edge case testing and refinement
- Make it look nicer
- Add a sidebar with examples and explanation of entry syntax
- Have the output formatted with buffer divs as well
